webpack-react-redux-boilerplate
===============================

A brief example demonstrating webpack with react 0.15 and redux + redux-thunk.

The app is a counter (initialized at count = 5) and provides a button for incrementing the count by 1.

Why I made this
===============

I forgot how redux worked since [I made my last boilerplate](https://github.com/petermikitsh/webpack-react-starter). And to critique the old boilerplate, it was full stack, and hard to learn from since it utilized so many different technologies. This one is exclusively front end tech.
